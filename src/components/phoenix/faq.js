    a:
      "Students can work on teams of 4 on projects related to software engineering, data science, and machine learning. Examples of previous projects include a data visualization dashboard for a grocery retailer, an anomaly detection software for a networking company, and a radio frequency classifier app for the Department of Defense. You should expect the scope of the project to be such that a team of 4 students can complete the project within a 3-month time frame."

    a:
      "Students will work directly with problem sponsors to establish goals and a timeline for each project. Students will also be responsible for a set of deliverables to be presented on the last day of the program. This could include a full product, research paper, white paper, and/or grant application."

    q: "Why should my company participate?",
    a:
      "The Phoenix Project brings two sources of value to a company. The first is an opportunity to help students during a global crisis. Many of these students expected experiences this summer to learn more about their professional interests and broaden their skillset. This is a way for companies to reinstate some of that learning experience back into students’ lives. Second, companies have the opportunity to have a valuable project managed and completed for them. This is a great way for companies to engage in exploratory projects."
