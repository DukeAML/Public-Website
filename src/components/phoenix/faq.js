    q: "What kinds of projects can students work on?",
    a:
      "Students can work on teams of 4 on projects related to software engineering, data science, and machine learning. Examples of previous projects include a data visualization dashboard for a grocery retailer, an anomaly detection software for a networking company, and a radio frequency classifier app for the Department of Defense. You should expect the scope of the project to be such that a team of 4 students can complete the project within a 3-month time frame."

    q: "What qualifications do students have?",
    a:
      "All participants of The Phoenix Project are Duke University students studying computer science, mathematics, statistics, and/or engineering. Many students have industry experience working at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. Students are experienced with independently setting and delivering goals."

  {
    q: "What time commitment is expected from my team?",
    a:
      "As a project sponsor, you are expected to participate in at least bi-weekly check-ins with the team working on your project. Project sponsors are encouraged to check in more frequently to provide mentorship and guidance for the projects."

    q: "Will my team have to pay to participate?",
    a:
      "Project sponsors are encouraged to contribute a $1000 summer-long stipend for each student working on their project. Duke has also provided some funding for students to subsidize students working on unpaid projects."
  },
  {
    q: "What can we expect upon completion of this program?",
    a:
      "Students will work directly with problem sponsors to establish goals and a timeline for each project. Students will also be responsible for a set of deliverables to be presented on the last day of the program. This could include a full product, research paper, white paper, and/or grant application."

  {
    q: "What is this program’s affiliation with Duke University?",
    a:
      "This program is being run through Duke University’s Applied Machine Learning Group in conjunction with the Innovation & Entrepreneurship department. All participating students are current Duke students and students’ participation will be partially subsidized through the university."
  },
  {
    q: "Why should my company participate?",
    a:
      "The Phoenix Project brings two sources of value to a company. The first is an opportunity to help students during a global crisis. Many of these students expected experiences this summer to learn more about their professional interests and broaden their skillset. This is a way for companies to reinstate some of that learning experience back into students’ lives. Second, companies have the opportunity to have a valuable project managed and completed for them. This is a great way for companies to engage in exploratory projects."
