    q: 'What types of ideas/projects/businesses will be accepted into the cohort?',
    a: 'We are looking for projects that implement data science, software, hardware, and other engineering solutions, but you’re free to tackle any problem/solution! Innovation comes from creativity, and we do not want to limit you with a specific prompt or topic. However, as you submit your ideas and project proposals, please try to keep feasibility in mind.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does the application process look like?',
    a: 'The application process will consist of 2 rounds. The first is a basic application form where you will submit information about your idea/startup and a brief slide deck outlining the general scope of the project. The second and final round consists of a virtual pitch of the idea and other questions for us to get to know you better.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What kind of engineering talent is available and how big will the team be?',
    a: 'DAML as well as other engineering groups on campus will be vetting applicants within their organization to ensure you have a team of engineers capable of building and testing your solution. We have BMEs, ECEs, Computer Scientists, Environmental and Civil Engineers, as well as Statisticians and Data Scientists. Your team size will be determined by what we feel the need is, and we will prioritize students who believe in your mission.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What other resources are available to me as a part of the Innovation Studio?',
    a: 'Through Duke I&E, DTech, and Contrary Capital, we will be organizing professional workshops and speaker serieses throughout the semester to coach you through the startup process, all the way from assessing the feasibility of an idea to bringing it to market. You will also gain exclusive opportunities to pitch your work at an end-of-semester Demo Day for more funding from us or investors.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What legal agreements exist between the engineers working and my individual IP (Intellectual Property)?',
    a: 'SAs of now, we do not provide contracts between student founders and engineers. If you wish to continue pursuing the startup with members of your engineering team after the program, feel free to do so then. Our role is to facilitate connections and help you get paired with students interested in your project.',

    q: '(For DAML members) Is participating in the Innovation Studio required?',
    a: 'Nope, working on any of these projects is completely voluntary (just like any other DAML client project). However, we really hope that all of you would consider working on these exciting startup ideas! (there may be a stipend to fund your work too)',
  },
  {
    q: 'How were the startups/ideas for the cohort chosen?',
    a: 'After the ideas have been submitted, the DAML Innovation Studio Team will interview and choose a select few startups for the Spring 2021 cohort. The startups will focus on a wide range of industries & problems centering around software/AI, allowing engineers to gain relevant technical experience across various domains.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What kind of engineering is involved?',
    a: 'We have software, hardware and data science roles – and you can specify your preference on our application. If you’re interested in product management roles, you will need to complete the DAML PM product evaluation to be considered for the role.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are projects compensated?',
    a: 'The goal is to have all engineers and PMs compensated for their work, however we are currently in the process of securing that funding so we cannot guarantee anything :) But stay tuned for updates about this!',
